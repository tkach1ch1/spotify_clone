## About 

This is a working clone of the world famous Spotify music player.

### _Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è_

As it is unallowed due to spotify API rules to get full track duration, so it is only 30 sec track duration in player for demonstration available.
Sometimes there is no 30 sec track preview for some tracks, so just skip to the next one üòâ

## Setup

Inside the project, you can run some built-in commands:

- To start the project locally in **development** mode:

### **_npm start_** or **_yarn start_**

When you run the project, a new browser tab will automatically open on your computer's default browser to view the app.

The development server will start up on _http://localhost:3000_.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

- To start the project in **production** mode:

### **_npm build_** or **_yarn build_**

This command builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The app is ready to be used.
